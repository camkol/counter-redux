### The challenge

Users should be able to:

## My process

- Import the `createStore()` helper function from the `'redux'` library.
- Create a `store` object that holds the entire state of your Redux application using `createStore()`.
- Get the current state of the `store` using `store.getState()`.
- Dispatch actions to the `store` using `store.dispatch(action)`.
- Create action creators to reduce the repetitive creation of action objects.
- Register a change listener function to respond to changes to the store using `store.subscribe(listener)`.
- Recognize the pattern for connecting Redux to any user interface.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Mobile-Responsive Design
- JavaScript - Scripting language
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

This was a class project to learn core concepts of Redux.

### Continued development

maybe use later
